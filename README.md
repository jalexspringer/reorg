# ReOrg: Straightforward project management with a Slack interface
### Problem: Existing project management solutions lack integration with the activities actually required to complete tasks
### Solution: Eliminate context switching by making it easy to review, update, and log time for tasks right from Slack or similar tools
### Technology:
- Written in Python
- Built on the python-rtmbot framework
- RethinkDB NoSQL database
- Slack interface
- Mobile and web apps

### I/O
- Conversational style - "I completed xxx"
- Communicate with managers and record comms
- Eliminate flood of messages in inboxes and slack channels
- Export team info into reporting (time spent, productivity, etc)
- Realtime notifications using the RethinkDB architecture
- Scalable - add teams, orgs, etc.
